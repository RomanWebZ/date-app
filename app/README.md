# app

SecretHeaven is a demo dating application built with Vue 3. The UI is tuned
for small screens and can also run inside an Apache Cordova wrapper for mobile
devices. A small Express server backed by SQLite is provided for development.

The front end persists its state in local storage so it works offline as well.
